# Xire-Life: Health and Fitness App Prototype

## Project Overview

Xire-Life is a prototype for a health and wellness application designed to help users achieve their lifestyle goals in an interactive and engaging way. This project, created using Figma, focuses on addressing the growing need for at-home fitness and wellness solutions, especially in light of the sedentary lifestyles and challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Features and Highlights

The Xire-Life app prototype includes the following features:

- **Task Variety**: Users can participate in three distinct tasks to improve their lifestyle. These tasks are designed to be both engaging and effective.
- **Accessibility**: The prototype emphasizes accessibility through features like easy navigation, reachability, visual clarity, language preferences, and closed captions.
- **User-Centric Design**: The app's design is guided by concepts from human-computer interaction (HCI), ensuring that the user experience is intuitive and effective.
- **Interactivity**: The prototype provides a fun and interactive approach to meeting health and fitness goals.

## Project Details

This project explores various stages of app development, including:

- **Requirements Gathering and Planning**: Background research and literature review to identify functional and non-functional requirements.
